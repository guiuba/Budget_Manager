# Budget_Manager
A quite interesting program to analyze  expenses : )
This is my implementation to Budget Manager Jet Brains Academy project, stage 5/5. Doing this I learned several cool things like why to use and how to implement the 
Strategy Pattern, Serializable basics to store relevant data as objects and also how to better use inheritance to organize code.
